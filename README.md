# COMPSCI255-Project6
This Project is a C++ template OrderedList.

The OrderedList is a linked list of Node pointer elements. Each time an element is added, it is added to its sorted position.

As mentioned, the OrderedList is a linked list of Node pointer elements. The Node, as defined in this class, is an element that has a data, and a link to the next Node in the OrderedList. If there is no next element, the link field should be NULL.

This OrderedList also has an iterator defined.
